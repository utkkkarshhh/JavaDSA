Type Conversion:
Converting one Data Type into another is Type Conversion.
Type conversion is possible with few conditions and situations.

For example: int number = 'A';
             System.out.println(number);
             => It would return 65 as output becasue of automatic type coversion, 65 is ASCII code for upper-case A.

Type Casting:
Type casting can be used to interpet one kind of data type into another.
For example: int num = 65.98f;  -> This would throw an error.

So Type casting can convert this value using this approach: 
int num = (int)(65.98f);s here an float number is converted to an interger data type.

Type Promotion:
Similary if these data types do not have enough capacity in terms of storage, it would automatically promote the data type.

For example: 

int a = 257;
byte b = (byte)(a);
System.out.println(b);

Instead of giving 257 as output, it would give 1 because a Byte has storage space of 256. So it would throw remainder as an output which is 257%256 = 1;

Another example: 
byte a = 40;
byte b = 50;
byte c = 100;
int d = a * b / c; -> Result here would be 20. 40*50 = 2000; 2000/100 = 20

Here Byte is able to store 2000 as value because of automatic Type Promotion. As the expression a*b is performed using Integer data type.
